Perhaps its closest cousin would be\u00a0Dear Esther, but where\u00a0Dear Esther\u00a0wastes the form of interactive entertainment,\u00a0Stanley Parable\u00a0uses and then subverts it. Where so many games that aspire to be more than games end up less than any form of art,\u00a0Stanley Parable\u00a0strives, and then succeeds, to be every game ever created. Even so, holding the game to the standards of any other title is simply not going to be correct.\n\nSo, how do you review what has become known as\u00a0The Stanley Parable HD, the full-scale reimagining of one of the most intriguing mods available online? How do you discuss it, analyze it, and recommend it?\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s quite simple.\u00a0\n\nYou don\u2019t.",

When I sense that a game is trying to usher me down a particular path, to get me to run from left to right or maybe to charge straight ahead, I need to satisfy my instinct to go against the grain, to explore, to see what the designers have put back the other way. Sometimes I find a 1-up or a collectible stashed away to reward me for my intrepid behavior. At other times, my explorations are rewarded only by the crushing disappointment of running up against an invisible wall. Whatever I find or don't find, my action is a manifestation of my desire to exert some independence, to make my own choices within a system that severely limits my options and encourages certain, specific behaviors.",
    "translated": "I've always been someone who gets it \"wrong\" in sports. When I feel like the game is forcing me to turn my head left and right or run in a straight line and I think I might have problems with my posture, I explain that it is important to pay attention to my differences. Happiness. A way to restore. Sometimes I get the first payment or order for my hero. Sometimes my mere presence causes confusion and bumps into apparent walls. Like it or not, my work reflects my desire for freedom and choices within a system that limits me and encourages me to do other things."

The Stanley Parable is both a richly stimulating commentary on the nature of choice in games (and in other systems, too, like our workplaces and our families) and a game that offers some of the most enjoyable, surprising, and rewarding choices I've ever been confronted with in a game. Going the wrong way has never felt so right.",
    "translated": "I think the Stanley Parable is an adaptation of the Charlie Kaufman video game and Spike Jonze movie. Many movies make fun of how they fool the audience with complicated plots and when the characters learn important life lessons. On the other hand, I am amazed at the change in the environment and environment in which people learn good life lessons. Stanley's illustration is a brilliant statement about the nature of choice in sports (and other structures such as work or family) and is one of the most interesting, surprising and fun choices I've ever seen. I survived the game. Misunderstandings are not fun."
