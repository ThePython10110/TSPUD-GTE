The Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe: Google Translate Edition

Look in the `releases` directory for releases (I'm too lazy to actually use Git).

Currently, it translates all the text (and nothing else). See all the translations in `lines.json`.

This is mostly just all the files that might be useful to others. I'm not distributing the code I actually used to make this because it's terrible and only good enough to do the job.

I'm using UABE (not the 3.0 alpha because it doesn't work correctly) to make the installer.
